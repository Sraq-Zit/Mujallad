## Mujallad App 1.0.0
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.

I made this application, to make reading and downloading books from [NoorBook](https://www.noor-book.com/) easy and simple.

This NoorBook library contains a great number of Arabic, Islamic and international books with millions of visitors every month, however, like any other website, it has lots of annoying ads, and requires unnecessary registration and wait for downloads.
Since I could not find an app that deals with the aforementioned issues, I decided to develop this simple app, which has many features such as reading, downloading, and searching for books, authors, categories and more.

## Pros
- ✅ Read books online without ads.
- ✅ Download books without registration or waiting.
- ✅ Search for books, authors, and categories.
- ✅ Other general features such as language, night mode, and favorites.
- ⌛ Convert books to known formats such as pdf and epub.
- ⌛ Notes and comments.
- ⌛ Highlight parts of the book and save or share them.
- ⌛ Platform for sharing audio books.
 
Any idea, note or criticism that will improve the application is welcome, via the email address: kingofmestry@gmail.com

## Cons
- ❌ Many people using this app may harm the owners of the website. I advise anyone who can to donate via [this link](https://www.noor-book.com/donate).
- ❌ Navigation is done by tapping on the sides of the book, not by scrolling up and down, and the former is usually better. The reason for that is presumably that scrolling requires loading the entire book, but this can be fixed later.
- ❌ Since the tester of the app is the developer himself, he may overlook some details, so please report any bugs you find using the email above.
- ❌ The app is only available for Android for now.

## Download
